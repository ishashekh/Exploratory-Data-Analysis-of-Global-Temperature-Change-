## 🛠️ Project Workflow

### Step 1: Data Loading & Inspection
- **Objective**: Load and inspect data to understand its structure, identify issues, and gather preliminary insights.

### Step 2: Data Cleaning
- **Handling Missing Values**: Fill missing values in categorical columns with placeholders and use the median to fill missing numerical values.
- **Data Type Standardization**: Ensure numeric consistency across year columns for easy calculation.
- **Remove Duplicates**: Eliminate duplicate records to maintain data integrity.

### Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Global Temperature Trends**: Calculate average temperature changes over time to detect warming or cooling trends.
- **Country-Specific Analysis**: Explore temperature variations for specific countries (e.g., Canada) over time.
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Analyze month-by-month data (e.g., January) to understand seasonal temperature trends.

### Step 4: Visualization
- **Line Charts**: Visualize overall global trends and country-specific patterns in temperature change over time.
- **Heatmap**: Provide a geographic representation of temperature change across regions and years.

### Step 5: Conclusion & Key Insights
- Summarize findings, discuss observed trends, and suggest areas for further research.
